\section{Implementation}


\subsection{\ttt{Hex}}

Directions were renamed to be more intuitive, and they were removed
from the public interface to be accessible only through \ttt{all\_directions}
and the utility functions \ttt{opposite} as well as \ttt{neighbors}.\\

\ttt{read\_grid} was made to be robust : it is able to read problems even
if they contain extra lines before \ttt{<problem>} or after \ttt{</problem},
and it is able to adapt itself depending on the parity of the line which
features indentation.
