\section{Usage}\label{sec-usage}

\subsection{\ttt{make} targets}

By default, \ttt{make} builds the \ttt{pingouin} executable.\\
\ttt{make test} will run unit tests (see \ref{subsec-structure}) for all functions of
\ttt{Priority} and \ttt{Bitset} that are part of the original
interface (see \ref{sec-additions} for more details).\\

Note that source code has been moved to \ttt{src/}, the \ttt{Makefile} has
been adapted in consequence.
