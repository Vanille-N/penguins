\section{Optimizations}
\subsection{\ttt{1}, \ttt{X}}

In many of the problems an optimal path, or at least a path close to the optimum,
can be obtained by only using ``single'' moves (i.e. of the form \ttt{(d,1)}),
or ``extremal'' moves (i.e. of the form either \ttt{(d,1)} or \ttt{(d,n)} when
\ttt{(d,n+1)} is not allowed).\\

It has been observed (see \ref{benchmarks}) that searching for an optimal
solution with such a restriction of moves often improves performance.\\
The added cost of exploring a whole tree of configurations is compensated
by the fact that this tree smaller than the full tree of allowed moves
enables removing many branches that are such terrible configurations
that it is possible to do better even with more restrictions on allowed moves.\\

This is implemented in two variants that can be enabled with the option flags
\ttt{-o1} (``single'' moves) and \ttt{-oX} (``extremal'' moves), or even
\ttt{-o1X} (both, with ``single'' first and ``extremal'' next).\\
